       The KKiinnwwaallkkeerr algorithm predicts RNA  folding  trajectories  and  first
       passage  times  by  connecting  the  denatured state with the predicted
       native structure through a series of intermediate states.

       KKiinnwwaallkkeerr splits the folding process into a series of events where each
       event  can either be a folding event or a transcription event.  In each
       transcription event one base from the RNA sequence is appended  to  the
       already  transcribed and (partially) folded subsequence. KKiinnwwaallkkeerr exe-
       cutes transcription events at regular time intervals. In  each  folding
       event a subsequence of the already transcribed RNA sequence is selected
       and a new structure is formed by combining base pairs from the  current
       structure  with  base pairs from the mfE structure of that subsequence.
       This is done in such a way that the new structure includes  base  pairs
       from  both  structures in an energetically favorable manner.  KKiinnwwaallkkeerr
       estimates the waiting times for individual folding events depending  on
       the  height of the energy barrier between the current structure and the
       new structure into which the molecule is folded. Folding events between
       structures  can  only occur, if the energy barrier between them is less
       than the maximum allowed energy barrier. As folding paths can  only  be
       calculated   exhaustively   for   short  sequences  (n>100),  heuristic
       approaches have to be employed which explicitly construct a (re)folding
       path between the two structures. The saddle height is then estimated as
       the highest point along the path. The best known algorithm for approxi-
       mating  saddle  heights  between  RNA conformations is the Morgan-Higgs
       heuristic, which tries to find a folding path from an origin  secondary
       structure  to  a  target  secondary  structure where the maximum height
       along the path is minimal. The heuristic models  state  transitions  at
       base pair resolution.

       Uses  the _V_i_e_n_n_a_R_N_A package (currently available at _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._t_b_i_._u_n_i_-
       _v_i_e_._a_c_._a_t_/_~_i_v_o_/_R_N_A_/) for free energy calculations and determination  of
       locally optimal substructures.

       KKiinnwwaallkkeerr  reads the RNA sequence from stdin and returns the intermedi-
       ate states of the predicted folding trajectories along with first  pas-
       sage  times  and  energy  barriers.   KKiinnwwaallkkeerr terminates when the mfE
       structure is reached.

       Computes the folding trajectory of the sequence in hok.seq  and  writes
       it to hok.out. Folding starts with 50 nucleotide transcribed at a tran-
       scription rate of 80 nc/sec. Interrupted trajectories are allowed,  the
       'S'  barrier  heuristic  is used and only substructures of length up to
       100 nc are considered during transcription (windows_size).
